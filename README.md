2. Using the Product

## 2.1 General
Maladaptive is an FPS-style game (First Person Shooter) where the player sees the game world through the character's eyes. The game's implementation aims to use good game design principles, i.e., instead of explaining in words, the game's story and world are presented immersively using visuals and audio. The game world is navigated using the keyboard and mouse. The user interface is navigated with the mouse, clicking elements on the screen. The purpose of the game is to solve various puzzles while enjoying music and environments.
